## DONE

- Create workers processes dynamically
- Bind TCP ports dynamically (no port exhaustion problems)
- Send messages over TCP


### Readings

Things I read during the first week:

- [A deep dive into Distributed.jl](https://juntian.me/programming/A_Deep_Dive_into_Distributed.jl/)
  explains the control flow of Distributed. 
  While reading this, I noticed that ‚Äîby default‚Äî Distributed creates processes
  in detached mode, which means `SIGINT`s are not passed to them!
- [Beej's Guide to Network Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/)
  to review the order in which socket functions should be called.
- `man netstat(1)`. Darwin/MacOS doesn't include the `-p` flag to list PIDs. üò§
- Parts of `julia/base/proccess.jl`.

### Looking into the "state of the art"

Different ways to communicate Julia processes:

- [Distributed](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Distributed/)
- [RemoteREPL](https://github.com/c42f/RemoteREPL.jl):
  The code seems to be very well organized, but both the client and the server
  need to import the `RemoteREPL` module.
- [DaemonMode](https://github.com/dmolina/DaemonMode.jl):
  The goal of DaemonMode is to run Julia scripts faster. However,
  the client and server code is in the same file üòê,
  the client takes quite a while to start, and the messages sent to
  the server are not structured (newline-separated strings).
  The client does very little, and it might be faster if it was a shell script instead.
- [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl)


### Difficulties
 
Problems I had during the week:

- To ensure connecting to an available port, the `TCPServer` has to be bound manually.
- IO in Julia is buffered by default. `flush` when necessary!
- The port number can be passed to the worker via arguments or env variables.
  For now, I've settled on an env variable.


## TODO

Things to do next week:

- **Review Julia finalizers.** Sending signals to the worker seems to work.
  Right now, the only missing case is when the manager is terminated forcefully
  and doesn't send the interrupt signal to the worker.
  Pluto already handles it's own termination "gracefully", so this might not be a problem.
  In any case, since the worker is part of the same process group as the manager
  (this isn't true about Distributed),
  the OS should reclaim it after the manager dies.

- **Write simple "messaging protocol"** for communication between server and worker.
  It should have different types of messages including:
  - `eval` request
  - `completion` request
  - `exit` request
  The `eval` request should serialize messages appropriately.

- Talk to Dr. Pedraza (professor of distributed systems at the UNAL).
